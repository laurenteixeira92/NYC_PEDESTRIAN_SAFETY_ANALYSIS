# Visualizing NYC's Pedestrian Safety Problem
This repo contains code and graphics from a personal project of mine exploring . The project was inspired by an April 2023 article from the New York Times, ["When a Walkable City Becomes a Death Trap"](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/nyregion/traffic-deaths-nyc-vision-zero.html?unlocked_article_code=1gi5uH3t2H6TnCqph6pw9xviB9APXh0DxaC0EnhFOiKp_v7h3BF4SGk5WZPsudW66gnT5JdrOnLG8VfntBFZgUA4Pg0fK_DL16WDAkccxK4T6Mjkbmz7E4NFSJIjKTxq5wlmShvlND_SAdeOjDyLePMwf-tRvkAP_27t_ag4g18_-p1tpnG_db0M0IdaATiQ0jhO8rJqCaTpx1ovEGz6TV2y0zNOv2p1KT8vGpKmf52CJSzbZ3VmYZzOW3R_bHc36KVimCs5aDcFk_tsCjUqN_hhIGjOTsA7vT5rE94mjoCYTGbS4N9pCy1sq90d3kWbRpHBIFA8EhghEbi9GGeve2zHsSuBGrG_uw&giftCopy=4_Disclaimer&smid=url-share), which probes the worrying uptick in pedestrian deaths in New York, especially along Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue. My aim with this project was to further explore the spatial distribution of serious pedestrian incidents in Brooklyn and identify problem areas. Particular attention was paid to intersections, which the article notes are the most common site for pedestrian collisions.
